# GRAFCET instances
A library containing IEC 60848 GRAFCET example instances according to the [meta-model] proposed by [1](https://github.com/Project-AGRAFE/GRAFCET-meta-model).

## Usage
.grafcet-files are GRAFCET-instances in [XMI](https://www.omg.org/spec/XMI)-format according to the corresponding [GRAFCET meta-model](https://github.com/Project-AGRAFE/GRAFCET-meta-model).
They were created using a [Sirius](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/)-based graphical editor, wich can be found [here](http://example.com/tbd) soon.
