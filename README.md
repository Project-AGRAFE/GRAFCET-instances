# GRAFCET instances
A library containing IEC 60848 GRAFCET example instances according to the [meta-model](https://github.com/Project-AGRAFE/GRAFCET-meta-model) proposed by [1].

## Usage
.grafcet files contain GRAFCET instances in [XMI](https://www.omg.org/spec/XMI) format according to a proposed [GRAFCET meta-model](https://github.com/Project-AGRAFE/GRAFCET-meta-model).
The instances were created using a [Sirius](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/)-based graphical editor, wich can be found [here](http://example.com/tbd) soon.
